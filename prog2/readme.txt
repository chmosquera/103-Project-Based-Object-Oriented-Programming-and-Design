The elapsed time for my sorts appear as expected. 

For linear search, the best case occurs when the array is already sorted, which makes sense because per search, only one comparison is made. The worst case occurs when the array is reversely sorted because it will make (n - 1) comparisons, where n is the length of the array being searched. The average case, where the array is filled with random integers, has an elapsed time in between the best and worst case. 

For binary search, the best case occurs when the array is already sorted, its elapsed time being almost identical to linear search's. The worst case occurs when the array is reversely sorted, but is substantionally better than linear search's worst case. The average case is in between the best and worst case, and is better than linear search's. 

As the arrays got larger, the performance dropped and the elapsed time of each sort increased.
